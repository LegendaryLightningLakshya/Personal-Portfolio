			<h3>
				UPI was down and took a break- Here’s why it is not actually
				that bad:
			</h3>
			<p>
				It was just another college day. You grab a snack from the
				canteen, scan the QR code on the wall - and it fails. That’s
				what happened with many when UPI suddenly stopped working across
				all major apps like <strong>Google Pay</strong> and <strong>PhonePe</strong> which was quite
				annoying. Yes, and it was also a big reminder on how much we
				rely on it.
			</p>

			<h3>UPI- College students and across:</h3>
			<p>
				It’s a part of everyday life. Whether it’s paying for your mess,
				splitting bills after a movie or paying for your daily commute.
				UPI is everywhere. In fact, it handles over 80% of India’s
				digital payments today. That’s huge. And as said-

			<blockquote>
				“With great reach comes great responsibility.” – Comical change
				to original version from Spider-Man universe.
			</blockquote>
			<h3>Why was it down:</h3>
			<p>
				So, when it crashed, it wasn’t just a tech glitch - it was a
				reminder. Even some amazing things that adhere to such large
				audiences needs upgrades. More users, more apps, rising traffic
				means the system must level up too in order to provide a seam
				experience.
			</p>

			
			<h3>Should we worry?</h3>
			<p>
				UPI is going global, countries are adopting it, and due to all
				this, Visa and Mastercard are getting some serious competition
			</p>
			<p>
				So yeah, one hiccup doesn’t change the fact that UPI is one of
				the best things to come out of Indian tech industry.
			</p>
			<p>
				If it has already changed how we pay - it feels amazing to
				imagine what could an upgrade change next?
